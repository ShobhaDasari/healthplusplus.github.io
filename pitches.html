                            Behavior Design to Incentivize Sleep
                        </div>
                        <div class="text">
                            Sleep deprivation is a major public health issue. It's been linked to increased risks of diabetes, heart attack, stroke, cancer, obesity, and Alzheimer's; and drowsy driving causes up to 6,000 fatal car crashes a year. In the U.S., 42% of adults get less than 7 hours of sleep a night. While there are many causes of sleep deprivation, often it's a matter of willpower – we know we need to sleep, but we prioritize other activities instead. This saps both productivity and health. However, creative behavior design can solve this problem. Social accountability and timely reminders can help us resist the temptations of screen time to prioritize what we really need – a good night's sleep.

                            Developing a tool to screen for crossed eyes in underserved children to prevent permanent vision loss
                        </div>
                        <div class="text">
                            Amblyopia (or lazy eye) is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss in children, affecting 1.5-3.1% of all children. Vision loss leads to lower quality of life, and worse education and future income. There are several causes of amblyopia, including strabismus (or misaligned eyes), which affects 2.8-5.9% of children. Furthermore, we know from a recent study out of the University of Michigan that even among children with insurance, children from a family with a net income of < $25,000 a year have a 16% less chance of seeing an eye doctor than those making $150,000 - $250,000 a year, and a 20% less chance of being diagnosed with strabismus; even though we know the incidence is higher in poorer children. Undetected strabismus or delayed diagnosis will lead to permanent vision loss, which disproportionately affects poorer children. While there is ample work in allowing parents and primary care doctors to do vision screening in young children, there is little similar effort for simple diagnostic tools for strabismus. We need an automated tool to allow for early detection of strabismus at home, school, or in the pediatrician's office to reach this underserved population.

                            Personalized sleep optimization
                        </div>
                        <div class="text">
                            More than 60 million people in the United States alone suffer from insomnia and 80 million have insufficient sleep. Bad sleep leads to more than just a diminished quality of life - sleep loss leads to significant health risks, decreased performance at work and school, and an increased rate of accidents. The causes of bad sleep are a mystery. The gold standard laboratory assessment of sleep is cumbersome, expensive, and isn't useful for determining the causes of most forms of bad sleep. Recent advancements in sleep science, machine learning, and wearable sensors now afford us the opportunity to accurately gauge the causes of sleep disruption. A low cost solution for accurate, personalized assessment of sleep and the causes of its disruption would radically change the manner in which sleep problems are treated and have an indelible societal impact.

                            A Novel Blood Testing Platform for the Early Stage Detection of Ovarian Cancer and a Wide Variety of Other Life Threatening Diseases

                            Ovarian cancer is a devastating disease with approximately 250,000 new diagnoses per year worldwide. The five-year survival rate for stage IV ovarian tumors is a mere 35%, which is primarily due to the lack of a simple, rapid, non-invasive test for routine screening. If detected during stage I, the five-year survival rate jumps to 99%. We need a new non-invasive test for detecting ovarian cancer in its early stages, when survival rates are highest. An ideal solution would be easily transferrable to other life threatening diseases that would also benefit from early detection.

                            Decreasing costs and improving outcomes for Comprehensive Joint Replacement procedures in light of bundled payments from CMS
                        </div>
                        <div class="text">
                            The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are moving to bundled payments to reimburse hospital organizations for complex procedures, starting with comprehensive knee and hip replacements (CJR). These procedures are common but still complicated and require multiple visits with the patient and multiple clinicians and specialties are involved. Organizations are struggling to address a fixed fee reimbursement for procedures they used to have many separate charges for, and could increase charges for more complex/difficult patients. With bundled payments all patients are reimbursed the same by CMS, and furthermore, hospitals are penalized for readmissions as they are not reimbursed for the additional costs. How can identify and capitalize on opportunities to streamline clinical processes, identify risks, and optimize outcomes?

                            Patients are often the most underutilized caregivers in our healthcare system. We need to find ways to empower patients to help care for themselves by providing the necessary education and tracking tools to improve their own health. Patient education is an often overlooked tool in our healthcare system that can improve outcomes cost effectively. Hospitals and clinics spend significant amounts of money on content and distribution of patient education materials but do not have efficient ways to assess the effectiveness of the education, or if it was even used or understood. Patient education is often addressed during the patients admission (when they are most incapacitated), or right before discharge (when all they want to do is go home), and there aren't many effective tools to follow up and ensure patients are educated appropriately. Many of these tools are simply to meet the requirement that education was provided to the patient, not actually ensure the patient actually understood the material, or reviewed it ever again. There is a significant opportunity to make better health more affordable simply by educating people more effectively. How can we use technology to distribute, monitor and improve patient education content, delivery and related outcomes?
