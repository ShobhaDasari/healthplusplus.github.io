    <h1>Lloyd Minor, MD</h1>
    <h5>Dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine.</h5>
    <p>
       Lloyd B. Minor, MD, is a scientist, surgeon, and academic leader. He is the Carl and Elizabeth Naumann Dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, a position he has held since December 2012. He is also a professor of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery and a professor of Bioengineering and of Neurobiology, by courtesy, at Stanford University.
    </p>
    <p>
       As dean, Dr. Minor plays an integral role in setting strategy for the clinical enterprise of Stanford Medicine, an academic medical center that includes the Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Health Care, and Stanford Children’s Health and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford. With his leadership, Stanford Medicine has established a strategic vision to lead the biomedical revolution in Precision Health, a fundamental shift to more proactive and personalized health care that empowers people to lead healthy lives.    
    </p>
    <p>
        Before coming to Stanford, Dr. Minor was provost and senior vice president for academic affairs of The Johns Hopkins University. Prior to his appointment as provost in 2009, Dr. Minor served as the Andelot Professor and director (chair) of the Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and otolaryngologist-in- chief of The Johns Hopkins Hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
        With more than 140 published articles and chapters, Dr. Minor is an expert in balance and inner ear disorders. In the medical community, Dr. Minor is perhaps best known for his discovery of superior canal dehiscence syndrome, a debilitating disorder characterized by sound- or pressure-induced dizziness. He subsequently developed a surgical procedure that corrects the problem and alleviates symptoms.   
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2012, Dr. Minor was elected to the National Academy of Medicine.

    <h5>CEO of TueoHealth</h5>
    <p>
      Bronwyn Harris, MD MS is co-founder and CEO of Tueo Health, a device-enabled digital health solution, initially focused on pediatric asthma. She first became interested in medical device development while she was an undergraduate student at Brown University.  After graduation she went to graduate school at University of Pittsburgh and studied decision support analysis applied to ventricular assist device implantations. While performing her research she felt something was missing, she wanted to better understand the patients she was designing for and how care is delivered. She decided to take a long detour from her path in medical device development. Medical school was the next step for her, followed by pediatrics residents and cardiology fellowship. During her fellowship she also completed the Stanford Biodesign fellowship, where she was able to combine her biomedical background and clinical expertise. The clinical need and solution for Tueo Health were first identified during the Biodesign fellowship. She recognizes the importance of not just presenting valuable data, but providing actionable insights and being able to tie those changes in clinical outcomes. While Bronwyn's primary focus is Tueo Health and making this solution a reality, she is also a pediatric cardiologist at Stanford part-time.
