We welcome individuals of all skillsets. Healthcare is interdisciplinary, and we hope our “hackers” will be too! Whatever your interest or specialty, we’d love to see what you can think up and create!</div>

                        <div class="answer">You're welcome to bring friends, but a big part of <span class="highlight">health++</span> is forming cross-disciplinary teams - engineers, designers, business experts, and clinicians - and that means meeting new people! Each group brings a unique skillset critical to creating meaningful solutions. From our experience, multilateral teams like these have seen the greatest success.</div>

                        <div class="answer">There is a large disconnect between engineering & design students who want to work on meaningful problems and healthcare professionals that understand how technology can be effectively applied to an unmet need. A health hackathon bridges this gap. The environment of a hackathon empowers students and faculty in healthcare with technical resources and engineering talent to push their ideas through the prototyping process.</div>

                        <div class="answer">We’re looking for a prototype, business model, or ideally, a combination of the two! We love technical hacks, but we also want to emphasize the importance of delivery and cost. How will your project get into the hands of patients? How can you ensure affordability? We want to see ideas and prototypes that have the potential to become reality.</div>
